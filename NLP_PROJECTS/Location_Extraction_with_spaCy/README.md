# Location Mention Recognition (LMR)
## Overview
### Title: Location Mention Recognition (LMR)

## Overview:
This project focuses on developing a machine learning model using spaCy to identify and extract location mentions (such as place names or street names) from microblogging posts like those on X (formerly Twitter). In disaster scenarios, location cues from these posts are crucial for effective response. Given the high volume of posts, manual extraction is impractical, and this model aims to automate the process, enabling authorities to quickly respond to critical needs.

## Aim
Your task in this project is to create a machine learning model that recognizes location mentions in microblogging posts. Accurate identification of location information can aid disaster response teams by providing essential location data for decision-making.

## Importance of the Model
- **Information Integrity:** Helps ensure accurate location information is identified from posts to facilitate rapid disaster response.
- **Misinformation Mitigation:** Automating the identification of location data reduces manual errors and improves efficiency.
- **Informed Decision-Making:** Extracting location cues from posts enables more informed and timely decisions in emergency situations.
## Technologies Used
- **Python:** For data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model building.
- **Natural Language Processing:** spaCy is used for text processing, location entity extraction, and model training.
- **Machine Learning:** A custom NER model built with spaCy to classify and extract location mentions from the text.
- **Data Analysis:** Pandas and NumPy are used for data manipulation and analysis.
- **Data Visualization:**  Matplotlib and Seaborn are employed for visualizing data trends and model performance.
