# Overview
## Title: Breast Cancer Analysis

**Overview:** Welcome to the Breast Cancer Analysis project! This project aims to utilize deep learning techniques to analyze medical data for breast cancer diagnosis. By leveraging advanced neural networks, we aim to build a model that can accurately predict whether a breast cancer tumor is malignant or benign based on diagnostic features. This analysis can assist medical professionals in early detection and improve patient outcomes.

## Aim
Your task in this project is to create a deep learning model that predicts whether a breast cancer tumor is malignant or benign based on diagnostic features. Accurate predictions can support early detection and treatment, ultimately improving survival rates and patient care.

# Importance of the Model
- Early Detection: Accurate models help in early detection of malignant tumors, which is crucial for effective treatment and improved survival rates.

- Clinical Support: Providing a reliable tool for medical professionals to assist in the diagnosis and treatment planning of breast cancer.

- Research and Development: Contributing to the field of medical research by applying deep learning techniques to healthcare data for the classification of tumor types.

# Technologies Used
- Python: Leveraging Python for data preprocessing, model building, and evaluation.

- Deep Learning: Utilizing libraries such as TensorFlow and Keras to implement neural networks for tumor classification.

- Data Analysis: Using tools like Pandas and NumPy for data manipulation and analysis.
