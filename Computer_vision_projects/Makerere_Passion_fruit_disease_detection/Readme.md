# Passion Fruit Disease Detection
## Overview
### Title: Passion Fruit Disease Detection

Smallholder passion fruit farmers in Uganda face significant yield losses and economic hardship due to the prevalence of pests and diseases. These farmers often lack the necessary information and resources for timely and accurate diagnosis, leading to delayed intervention and devastating crop losses. Therefore, there is a critical need for a readily accessible, affordable, and reliable diagnostic tool that enables farmers to quickly and accurately identify passion fruit diseases in the field.

This project leverages deep learning-based object detection to identify and classify passion fruit diseases from images, helping farmers take timely actions to mitigate losses.

## Aim
The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model capable of detecting and classifying passion fruit diseases from images. The model should provide accurate predictions, enabling farmers and agricultural experts to make informed decisions for early disease intervention.

## Importance of the Model
* **Early Disease Detection:**  Enables farmers to identify plant diseases at an early stage, preventing significant yield losses.
* **Affordable and Scalable:** Provides an accessible and cost-effective solution for smallholder farmers.
* **Improved Crop Yield:** By identifying diseases early, farmers can take timely actions to protect their crops and improve productivity.
* **AI-Powered Decision Support:** Assists agricultural experts and policymakers in disease monitoring and management.
## Technologies Used
* **Python:** For data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
* **Computer Vision:** Utilizes OpenCV and Torchvision for image processing and augmentation.
* **Deep Learning:** Implements Faster R-CNN, a state-of-the-art object detection model, for disease classification.
* **Torch & Torchvision:** Used for building and fine-tuning the detection model.
* **Albumentations:** Applied for image augmentation and transformation.
* **Pandas & NumPy:** For data handling and processing.
